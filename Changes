Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Tagset

2024-03-11  Andy Lester

        * Release 3.24

        No changes in functionality. Only updates metadata for builds.

        * Release 3.22

        HTML::Tagset now requires Perl 5.10.1. It might run on earlier
        Perls but I don't have the infrastructure to test them.

        Added <ins> and <del> to %isPhraseMarkup (RT #151970)

        Fixed docs about %isBodyElement calling it %isBodyMarkup
        (RT #34913, RT #109024, RT #118356)

        Cleaned up metadata and version requirements.

        No changes have been made to handle HTML5. That is a bigger issue
        than "just add the tags to the hashes," because that would change
        functionality for existing users who are expecting HTML::Tagset to
        be HTML4.

2000-10-20  Sean M. Burke

        * Release 3.03
        Added 'tr' => ['background'] at the suggestion of Renzo Toma
        (renzo.toma@veronica.nl), who notes: "Netscape Communicator 4.73
        (probably even earlier) supports it, Internet Explorer 5.5 does
        not (yet)."
